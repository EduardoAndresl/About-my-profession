Management Control Engineer 

To understand the function first  we have to understand the following issues inside of a company :
  1.think that less than 10% of the strategies formulated in companies are effectively executed.
  2 5% of employees understand the strategy
  3.25% of managers have incentives linked to strategy
  4.85% of management teams dedicate less than one hour per month to discussing strategy
  5.60% of companies do not link budget and strategy. 
  
  
-The main objective of management control is to reduce the gap between the planned (strategy) and actual (execution).  
-At the operational and management control level, it is important to break down the processes to find key points in the 
process and develop indicators, classes and assign responsibilities.
As a conclusion we can say that what is not measured, cannot be controlled and what is not controlled, cannot be managed,
it is for this main reason that it is important in business to make decisions based on key performance indicators.
    Here one of my main tasks is to help in the process of strategy implementation using different tools.
